        "\n",
        "Machine Learning is the science behind computer algorithms that help machines learn from data without explicit programming.\n",

        "### Types of ML\n",
        "\n",
        "There are different types of Machine Learning algorithms depending on how your data looks and what is the objective of your algorithm. We can classify them in three different types:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Supervised learning**: what we want the model to predict, we give it to it during training. It will learn to predict those values by minimizing the error between its prediction and the actual value (ground truth).\n",
        "Example: Spam filtering. We indicate to the algorithm which email messages are spam and which ones are not.\n",
        "- **Unsupervised learning**: there is no specific value we want the model to predict. We give it the input data, and we ask of it to uncover hidden patterns and relationships that might be useful for us.\n",
        "Example: Customer Segmentation in Marketing. We ask the model to create customer groups that might have similar needs. With that classification, companies are able to offer similar products to similar customers.\n",
        "- **Reinforcement learning**: in this case, we have an agent that learns how to take actions in a specific environment to maximize a reward signal.\n",
        "Example: robot navigating a maze. Each time the robots moves correctly, it receives a reward. If not, it receives a penalty. Slowly, it will learn what are the characteristics of the optimal path to get out of the maze.\n"

        "\n",
        "### Why?\n",
        "\n",
        "As we already know, ML models learn from the data we show them. However, the objective of training a model is so that we can use it to predict correctly the output of some data it has never seen before. When the model is in production (its final stage, predicting for the client or whoever needs it), we can assess if it is performing correctly or not. But shouldn't we be able to assess that **before** it reaches that stage?\n",
        "\n",
        "That is why we do not use all of our available data for training. We split it. We will show the model some of the data, and we will use the rest to see how it performs with data it has never seen before.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data splitting is done to assess two different things:\n",
        "- **Assess generalization**: we want to see how the model generalizes, how it performs with data it has never seen before, as we just said.\n",
        "- **Prevent overfitting**: overfitting happens when the model performs very well with the data it has seen during the training, and not so good with the data is has not yet seen. This usually happens when the model is more complex than it needs to be. The model ends up **learning** all of the training data, but it is not capable of generalizing. To see if there is overfitting or not, we have to see how the model performs with data it has not seen.\n",

        "- **We have enough data to see if it is capable of generalizing**. Just as with training, in the phase of testing we need another sample that would be representative enough of the population. In this case, is to avoid **high-variance** in the estimate of the model's performance.\n",

For example, if we want to try different values for learning rate, number of layers, and batch size, we define all the values we want to test for each parameter, and Grid Search evaluates every possible combination. While this method guarantees finding the best combination within the specified grid, it can be very computationally expensive, especially when the number of parameters or the range of values increases.\n",

Instead of blindly searching the space, it uses past results to choose the next set of parameters to evaluate, aiming to find the optimum with fewer evaluations. It builds a surrogate model (like a Gaussian Process) to predict performance and selects new points to evaluate based on a strategy like Expected Improvement. This approach is more efficient than both Grid and Random Search, particularly when training is expensive or the search space is large.\n",
